# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
Using the `Leaflet.js` library, `Javascript`, and `HTML/CSS` to create interactive maps that retrieve recent earthquake data from a `GeoJSON` file, plotting the results in real time. The data is retrieved from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) website, and plots geographical coordinates and magnitudes for earthquakes occuring in the last 7 days, which is then added to a map. The data is **real-time** and will update whenever a user accesses the map. As well as earthquakes, the interactive map also has multiple layers of visualization, as well as the lines of Earth's tectonic plates plotted across the map. Users can select whether to see All Earthquakes, Major Earthquakes, or the Tectonic Plates (or any combination thereof) at their discretion.
